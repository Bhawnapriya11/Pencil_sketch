# Pencil_sketch

Instead of Image3 specified here in pencil_sketch.py line number 23, you can replace your image and put this python file in the same directory as the image and run the python file to obtain a pencil sketch of the image.

You can play around with the kernel size specified in the Gaussian_blur function (Line number 17) and see how the pencil sketch gets modified as you change the kernel size.
