So if you ever wish to create a pencil sketch of any image you wish to without paying for those advanced photo editing softwares then you can make use of this python file to do the same using OpenCV.
The basic dodging and buring technique is used here for the same.


In pencil_sketch.py
Instead of Image3 specified here in line number 23, you can replace your image and put this python file in the same directory as the image and run the python file to obtain a pencil sketch of the image.
You can play around with the kernel size specified in the Gaussian_blur function (Line number 17) and see how the pencil sketch gets modified as you change the kernel size.
